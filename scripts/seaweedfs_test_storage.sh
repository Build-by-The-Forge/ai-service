# A real S3-compatible service for the AI-service's object-storage tests
# (P3-1 PR 4): SeaweedFS, pinned by digest (Phase 3 plan, D1 as amended).
# The same harness as build-backend's scripts/seaweedfs_test_storage.sh;
# keep the two in step.
#
#   scripts/seaweedfs_test_storage.sh start ENV_FILE   start, prove ready, write the test config
#   scripts/seaweedfs_test_storage.sh stop             remove the container and its data
#
# - Identities are generated for this run:
#   - admin creates the buckets during setup only and is never written out;
#   - writer-a may read, write and list bucket A (it seeds objects, as the
#     backend does); reader-a may only read A (as the AI-service may);
#   - writer-b may read, write and list bucket B.
# - The service runs as the invoking user, with its data on tmpfs, and
#   publishes only the S3 port, on 127.0.0.1.
# - Volumes are sized for a test store: 64 volumes of at most 64 MB.
# - Readiness is proven by a real write, not by /healthz. Setup fails closed
#   after a timeout, and checks that anonymous object access is denied.
# - ENV_FILE receives OBJECT_STORAGE_TEST_* (mode 600). In GitHub Actions,
#   pass "$GITHUB_ENV"; each secret is masked in the log first.
# - Needs: a Linux shell (CI, WSL), docker, and python with boto3 and httpx
#   (requirements.txt).
